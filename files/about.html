    <p class="about">The designers of this website are Lucas Ross (14) and Max Calcoen (14). We put hours of effort into the Bytehacks submission, and are excited, because we have done other hackathons in the past. We used python skills we taught ourselves in 7th grade and html and css skills we learned a few weeks ago!</p>
    <p class="about">Lucas Ross enjoys doing crafts projects, like making stuffed animals, and plays soccer
    and tennis. He plays videogames like Minecraft, Rocket League, Super Smash Bros and Valorant. He attends
    Head-Royce School, where he will be going into 9th grade in the 2020-2021 school year, taking a Computer Science course 1 year ahead of his grade.</p>
